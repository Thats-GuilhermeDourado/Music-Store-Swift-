# Music-Store-Swift-
Music Store is a super cool Swift app I whipped up in a short class. It lets you browse through artists and tracks, adding your favorites to a wishlist. Even as a beginner, I packed it with nifty features to make discovering and saving music a breeze. â€” definitely a fun project with loads of potential!
